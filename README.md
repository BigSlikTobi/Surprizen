# Surprizen - AI-Powered Gift Journey Platform

> Transform your gift ideas into personalized surprise experiences through AI-guided conversations and interactive puzzle journeys.

## üéÅ What is Surprizen?

Surprizen is an innovative platform that revolutionizes gift-giving by creating **personalized, puzzle-based surprise journeys** for your loved ones. Instead of simply buying a gift, you create an entire experience that leads the recipient through a series of engaging puzzles before revealing their final surprise.

### The Problem We Solve

Traditional gift-giving often feels impersonal and lacks the element of surprise and engagement. People struggle with:
- Finding meaningful, personalized gifts
- Creating memorable experiences around gift-giving
- Engaging recipients in the surprise process
- Making gifts feel special and thoughtful

### Our Solution

Surprizen uses **AI-powered conversations** to help you:
1. **Define your gift vision** through natural conversation
2. **Develop a surprise strategy** with personalized puzzle configurations
3. **Create a visual storyboard** of the complete journey
4. **Launch automated delivery** of puzzles through multiple channels
5. **Track progress** and celebrate the final reveal

## üåü How It Works

### The Complete Journey Process

#### Phase 1: Vision Creation üéØ
**What happens:** You chat with our AI assistant to define your gift vision.

**The conversation covers:**
- **Occasion**: Birthday, anniversary, holiday, or just because
- **Recipient details**: Name, age, interests, and your relationship
- **Budget preferences**: How much you'd like to spend
- **Timeline**: When you want the surprise to happen
- **Tone & style**: Fun, heartfelt, elegant, or playful

**Example conversation:**
```
AI: "Hi! What's the occasion for this gift?"
You: "It's my partner's birthday"
AI: "Wonderful! Tell me about their interests."
You: "They love books and cooking"
AI: "What's your budget range?"
You: "Around $100"
```

**Result:** A complete profile of your gift vision with all preferences captured.
