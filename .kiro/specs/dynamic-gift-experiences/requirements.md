# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dynamic Gift Experiences platform (Surprizen) is a next-generation solution that transforms traditional gift-giving into ongoing, personalized experiences tailored for Gen Z users. The platform uses AI technology to build detailed recipient personas and deliver contextual, shareable moments of joy through a near real-time experience engine. Rather than focusing on one-time grand gifts, the system creates a series of smaller, meaningful interactions that unfold dynamically based on recipient engagement and preferences.
